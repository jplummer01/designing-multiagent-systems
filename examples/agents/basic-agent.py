"""
Basic Agent Example - Simplified and WebUI discoverable

This example demonstrates creating a simple agent with tools.
The agent is defined at module level, making it discoverable by picoagentsui.

Run standalone: python examples/agents/basic-agent.py
Or discover via: picoagentsui --dir examples/agents
