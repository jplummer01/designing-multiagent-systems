The only problem was that I, for the life of me, could not remember my password. You see, this is a bit laughable because for the past year or so, I had typed in that exact password, sometimes from muscle memory. I had done it at the beginning of *that* week, all the days before, and even late the previous night.\\\\n\\\\nBut in that moment I couldn\\\\\\'t even remember the first letter. After about an hour, taking a break, missing a morning meeting, getting locked out (a Mac will do that after several failed attempts), I *did* get back in.\\\\n\\\\nThis wasn\\\\\\'t just about forgetting a password. It was a wake-up call \u2013 a small but telling sign of cognitive overload. As I sat there that morning, staring at my login screen, I realized this memory lapse was symptomatic of something larger: the mental toll of trying to keep pace with the relentless advancement of AI. You see, that period, like most of the year, had been marked by lots of effort to stay current \u2013 tracking breakthrough papers, implementing new models, adapting to paradigm shifts, all while maintaining regular work responsibilities. And I wasn\\\\\\'t alone. In conversations with colleagues across the AI research and engineering space, a pattern emerged. While we all shared genuine excitement about being in the field during this revolutionary time, there was also an undercurrent of exhaustion \u2013 a particular kind of fatigue that comes from trying to match the unprecedented pace of AI advancement.\\\\n\\\\nThis is what I\\\\\\'ve come to think of as **\"AI Fatigue.\"**\\\\n\\\\n> Note: This post is more of a personal reflection, than other more focused AI/Agents posts. It\u2019s inspired by some recent events. Bear with me.   \\\\n> *Podcast Audio is generated using NotebookLM[1](https://newsletter.victordibia.com/p/you-have-ai-fatigue-thats-why-you#footnote-1-154157793)*\\\\n\\\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F404dda91-93db-4040-ab0c-864d2fb193e3_1901x1163.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F404dda91-93db-4040-ab0c-864d2fb193e3_1901x1163.png)\\\\n\\\\n> **AI fatigue** is the collective exhaustion experienced by individuals and organizations in response to the unrelenting pace of AI advancement. It reflects the mental, emotional, and operational toll of trying to adapt to an unprecedented rate of change that has sustained for a relatively long period (24+ months) with little/no signs of slowing down.\\\\n\\\\nIn some way, it\\\\\\'s an acknowledgement that the pace of AI is *gargantuan*[2](https://newsletter.victordibia.com/p/you-have-ai-fatigue-thats-why-you#footnote-2-154157793) and adapting to it has costs that we must all be clearly aware of. The duration of this rapid pace has also been gargantuan - the release of ChatGPT (~ 24 months ago, Nov 2022) marked the beginning of this period .. that sometimes feels like many, many years.\\\\n\\\\nAnd it is new territory for the humans of AI, and organizations too.\\\\n\\\\n[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc89aa95-9c44-4c5b-9deb-bf53e7e23517_1901x1163.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc89aa95-9c44-4c5b-9deb-bf53e7e23517_1901x1163.png)\\\\n\\\\nWhen I say the pace is gargantuan, what do I mean?

Dibia shares a personal experience of cognitive overload caused by trying to keep pace with AI progress, illustrating the stressful nature of this high-speed technological change. He notes that AI advances, marked by events like the release of ChatGPT, have been relentless over the past 24 months, contributing to mental, emotional, and operational stress. Dibia highlights the overwhelming volume of AI research, citing thousands of papers submitted monthly to platforms like arXiv, signaling the vast amount of new information to absorb continually. This experience of fatigue is shared among AI researchers and professionals, shaping a broader narrative about managing the toll of staying updated with AI developments.\n",
