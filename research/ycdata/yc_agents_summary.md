- AI Sell: AI Sales Associate for Ecommerce We're building AI Sales Associates for eCommerce. Imagine going on nike.com and facetiming an AI Lebron James and getting his advice on which his shoes to buy. Traditional brick-and-mortar retail stores rely on sales associates to provide personalized customer service, guide product discovery and close sales, but it's always been too expensive and unscaleable for online stores. We're building video-based AI agents that are experts in their products and can gently steer customers to a purchase, delighting customers and lifting conversion/AOV.

Jerry and Jeffrey are brothers who previously worked together to scale The Coding School to a 6mil+ in revenue. Jerry built software to help run the 50+ Shopify brands that Openstore acquired more profitably and efficiently. He was also an engineer at Flexport and Google.

**Manufacturing**
- Maive: Visual AI for factories Maive automates aerospace compliance paperwork required on the manufacturing shop floor. We use cameras and AI to automatically fill federally-required paperwork, reducing the risk of companies being unable to sell their products and increasing factory throughput.

Users have told us the paperwork required for the F-35 fighter jet weighs more than the jet itself! The government requires a record for each of the 1.5 million parts in the jet, including what shop-floor workers do to each part and when they do it.

Automating paperwork by interpreting human actions with cameras is hard. Doing this at the edge and inside secure aerospace environments is harder. We fine-tune the latest vision language models to solve what was previously impossible.

Manufacturers lose millions when compliance paperwork has errors because it can freeze their ability to sell the product for months. Leaving this task to shop floor workers is both incredibly risky to the company and tedious for the employees. 

Compliance paperwork is just the beginning. We want to propel American manufacturing into the AI era. America is facing a serious problem: there’s $400B being invested to onshore manufacturing, but there’s simultaneously a projected 15% gap in workers needed due to an aging workforce. We’re on a mission to solve this by building the first AI native software for the shop floor. Our vision is to intelligently connect people, robots, and data to 10x today’s manufacturing capacity.
  - Value prop: The company uses AI models to autonomously interpret human actions via cameras and automatically fill compliance paperwork on behalf of users, effectively acting as a generative AI agent delegated to handle this task.

- Fiber AI: We automate SDR / BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI Fiber AI automates SDR and BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI. Enterprises choose our AI sales platform because we automatically find prospects, research them, and hyper-personalize outbound messages that get 80% open rates, which is 4x the industry standard (our AISDR / AIBDR platform 2-4x's the reply rates you are currently getting).


Our AI sales platform consists of 3 core components:

First, Fiber AI manages domain and email health to achieve 80% open rates. We configure cold email infrastructure to maximize email deliverability. Our product will automatically configure your DNS records, warm up your emails (email warmup), orchestrate emails to send optimally across all your accounts, run multi-layer email bounce detection (email waterfall), and modify each outgoing cold outreach to ensure your cold outbound sales emails don't trigger spam filters.


Second, we automate sales lead generation with dynamic audiences (AI powered sales assistant, AI based SDR). We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts, sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.


Lastly, our AI sales copilot (AI sales agent, AI based BDR) enables AI powered hyper-personalized emails that boost response rates. The biggest debate in sales is choosing between relevancy and personalization—now you don’t have to. We search far and wide to find the “golden nugget” of information to connect with your prospect, and then use GPT-4 to write hyper personalized email sequences that dramatically increase reply rates and book meetings.


Because of these core differences, we stand out from competitors. Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails. AI features to autopilot campaigns are missing in products like smartlead ai, instantly, unify gtm, penguin ai, and warmly ai. Currently, our philosophy is to allow AI to 100-1000x your team's output while maintaining extremely high email quality. AI sales copilots like reggie ai, aisdr, artisan ai / artisan sdr / artisan bdr, and others let gpt use AI to generate the entire email, which results in poor outbound email quality since SDRs/BDRs don't have fine-tune controls on the personalization.
  - Value prop: The company uses generative AI models (GPT-4) to autonomously generate hyper-personalized outbound sales emails and automate prospecting and lead generation workflows, effectively acting as AI sales agents on behalf of users.
