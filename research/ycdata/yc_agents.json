    "desc": "We automate SDR / BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI Fiber AI automates SDR and BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI. Enterprises choose our AI sales platform because we automatically find prospects, research them, and hyper-personalize outbound messages that get 80% open rates, which is 4x the industry standard (our AISDR / AIBDR platform 2-4x's the reply rates you are currently getting).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur AI sales platform consists of 3 core components:\r\n\r\nFirst, Fiber AI manages domain and email health to achieve 80% open rates. We configure cold email infrastructure to maximize email deliverability. Our product will automatically configure your DNS records, warm up your emails (email warmup), orchestrate emails to send optimally across all your accounts, run multi-layer email bounce detection (email waterfall), and modify each outgoing cold outreach to ensure your cold outbound sales emails don't trigger spam filters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond, we automate sales lead generation with dynamic audiences (AI powered sales assistant, AI based SDR). We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts, sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, our AI sales copilot (AI sales agent, AI based BDR) enables AI powered hyper-personalized emails that boost response rates. The biggest debate in sales is choosing between relevancy and personalization\u2014now you don\u2019t have to. We search far and wide to find the \u201cgolden nugget\u201d of information to connect with your prospect, and then use GPT-4 to write hyper personalized email sequences that dramatically increase reply rates and book meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of these core differences, we stand out from competitors. Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails. AI features to autopilot campaigns are missing in products like smartlead ai, instantly, unify gtm, penguin ai, and warmly ai. Currently, our philosophy is to allow AI to 100-1000x your team's output while maintaining extremely high email quality. AI sales copilots like reggie ai, aisdr, artisan ai / artisan sdr / artisan bdr, and others let gpt use AI to generate the entire email, which results in poor outbound email quality since SDRs/BDRs don't have fine-tune controls on the personalization.",

Our platform unifies project management, materials management, finance, estimating, and CRM\u2014traditionally scattered across multiple systems\u2014into one cohesive solution. For the first time, construction firms can automate and oversee every aspect of their projects in a single, intuitive system. Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \r\n\r\nWe reduce \r\n\r\n- Manual work by 60%\r\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\r\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \r\n\r\nWhy Now?\r\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise. Sneha ( that\u2019s me), with over a decade of experience in supply chain management and lean manufacturing within the construction industry, has lived the pain of using ERPs in this industry.",

For carriers, integrating Oway can immediately increase annual revenues by up to 30% with almost no impact to existing delivery schedules.\r\n\r\nIn a technical sense, Oway applies stochastic spread optimization and real-time liquidity modeling to dynamically price freight shipments, effectively functioning as a decentralized market maker optimizing expected value across variable supply constraints.

Conversely, over the past decade, currency depreciation across the region has become unsustainable. (some countries surpassing the trillion percent ). \r\n\r\nKontigo solves this with a USDC global wallet & a BTC savings account. \r\n\r\n- Like Venmo, but on-USDC.\r\n- Like Zelle, but for cross-border payments. No limits.\r\n- Like Nubank & Revolut, but without inflationary currencies. Bitcoin-backed.\r\n\r\nUser wallets are connected to an AI-private banker on WhatsApp to execute international USDC transactions. ",

From fulfillment and inventory to returns, customer support, and shipment tracking, post-purchase operations are messy, manual, and expensive to scale. Zimi replaces the tangle of disconnected tools with one intelligent system that runs everything after the buy button.\r\n\r\nDespite billions spent on e-commerce tech, post-purchase operations remain a black hole\u2014leading to delays, unhappy customers, and skyrocketing support costs. Legacy ERPs are slow, customer service tools are reactive, and logistics platforms don\u2019t connect to CX systems\u2014forcing brands to patch things together with manual work and multiple tools.\r\n\r\nZimi solves this with a single platform that connects 147+ tools and sales channels to centralize data, automate workflows, and power AI agents that proactively resolve issues before customers even ask. Brands use Zimi to route orders intelligently, manage inventory across multiple 3PLs, reduce returns friction, and deliver world-class customer experiences\u2014without the operational chaos.\r\n\r\nWe built Zimi after watching high-growth brands lose time, money, and trust trying to scale with tools that were never designed to work together. Our founding team has deep experience across e-commerce, logistics, and SaaS, and we're building the post-purchase infrastructure every modern brand will need to compete.\r\n",

    "desc": "Drone detection for US defense and national security   The rise of weaponized drones has fundamentally transformed security threats both in warfare and civilian contexts. In Ukraine, $500 modified commercial drones regularly neutralize million-dollar military assets. At our southern border, cartels use drones to smuggle fentanyl and survey law enforcement positions. Critical infrastructure, military bases, and correctional facilities face unprecedented vulnerability to unauthorized surveillance and drone-based attacks.\r\n\r\nFounded in 2024, Guardian RF develops advanced RF spectrum sensors to protect against this evolving threat landscape. Our technology has been battle-tested in Ukraine, where consumer drones converted into precise guided missiles have become a daily reality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on regulatory compliance, our sensors can detect modified and non-Remote ID compliant drones from up to 3 km away, accurately pinpointing both drone and operator locations.\r\n\r\nWhat sets us apart is our distributed mesh network of sensors combining advanced Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology with AI-driven signal classification. Trained on extensive combat zone datasets, our system processes RF signatures in real-time across multiple frequency bands, catching even sophisticated stealth drones using frequency-hopping protocols. When a threat is detected, the system delivers precise targeting data while maintaining continuous tracking.\r\n\r\nOur product line includes:\r\n- Scout Detector: A handheld drone detector for rapid deployment and portability\r\n- Mosaic Sensor Network: A scalable mesh network of RF sensors for detecting, tracking, and mapping drone activity across expansive areas\r\n\r\nThe stakes are severe: along our borders, cartel drones facilitate trafficking that costs thousands of lives annually. In prisons, a single successful drone contraband delivery can trigger facility-wide violence. For critical infrastructure, a coordinated drone strike could cause billions in business interruption losses. Traditional drone defense systems, often priced in the millions, are cost-prohibitive for most organizations.\r\n\r\nGuardian RF bridges this critical gap with accessible, effective protection. Our AI classification engine recognizes various control protocols including modified ExpressLRS, Crossfire, and DJI variants, providing early warning of threats that traditional systems miss entirely. The system's fully automated detection, tracking, and response mechanisms ensure continuous protection with minimal operational overhead.\r\n\r\nBuilt and manufactured in the United States, Guardian RF combines field-proven technology with real-world deployment experience to counter modern drone threats. Whether safeguarding critical infrastructure, securing borders, or supporting defense operations, our systems deliver the comprehensive drone detection capabilities needed for today's security challenges.",

However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Approach: \r\nIn our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to chemists through our user-friendly no-code software platform and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.",

Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project\u2019s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\r\nSage\u2019s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\r\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren\u2019t going to cut it. \r\n\r\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called \u201cRAG\u201d (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.\r\n",

    "desc": "Building tools for verifying information consumed by AI agents We build tools that allows enterprises verify information about a user *before* processing it - whether it is processed by a human or an AI agent.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, these verifications including but not limited to background checks cost ~$10. Using our advancements in AI and Cryptography, we're able to send that cost to a few cents. \r\n\r\nThis enables enterprises to do verification at scale, earlier in their work-flows, and enables new kinds of businesses - which were not performing these verifications because of prohibitively high costs.\r\n\r\nFor example, it makes no sense that a recruiter does a candidate's document verification and background checks AFTER the candidate has cleared all the interviews. That's because that verification is cumbersome and expensive. They can't afford to verify all the candidates at the top of the funnel. Many such workflows are ripe for disruption. \r\n\r\nAnother example of a product that was not possible before. A dating app uses our tools to verify the users' information - including their employment, education and financial background. This was something that would have been too expensive to verify at a $10 pricepoint where the ARPU is only $8. \r\n\r\nNot only that, we're designing the tools ground up - so that AI agents can utilize these verifications before ingesting information, so that they take action basis truthful information.\r\n\r\nWe have 3 tools\r\n1. BlueCheck : our flagship product for background verification. The cheapest option to verify users' employment, education and financial background. A few cents instead of a few tens of dollars. Several Billion Dollar+ revenue companies are customers. A solution designed for enterprises that works out of the box!\r\n2. Reclaim Protocol : our underlying infrastructure that makes BlueCheck possible. With advancements in cryptography, specifically zero knowledge proofs - our research over the last 3 years have resulted in inventing a new cryptographic primitive called zkTLS, which allows us to verify information from any website using the cryptography of the existing internet pipes (TLS). This is our secret sauce!\r\n3. Questbook : our dog-fooding tool. Questbook is a tool to give out research and open source software development grants. These grants are reviewed by AI agents that we built inhouse. The biggest scam people try is to fake who they are when they are applying for grants. We dog-food our own tools to make sure we verify all the claims the users are making when they apply for grants. Our tools secure more than $10M of grants being given out on the platform. So it's high stakes, and it works!",

Misprint streamlines the process by combining accurate pricing analytics with a seamless buy/sell marketplace, making it easier than ever to understand and monetize collectible assets.\r\n\r\nExisting marketplaces lack robust, real-time analytics because accurate valuations require deep expertise in both the collectibles domain and advanced pricing algorithms. Misprint\u2019s unique blend of insider trading card knowledge and machine learning allows us to fill this gap.\r\n\r\nBuilding these pricing models requires extensive data infrastructure, deep domain expertise, and cutting-edge ML. Recent surges in the trading card market show that collectors crave transparent valuations.\r\n\r\nThe global collectibles market is worth tens of billions of dollars. Eva has experienced the scale of this industry firsthand, generating $500k ARR within three months of taking her Pokemon card-selling side hustle full-time. With additional segments like sports cards, comics, and emerging collectible categories, the growth runway is immense.\r\n\r\nCo-founders Eva and Jon have been best friends since Exeter, combining finance expertise, a passion for collectibles, and mathematical rigor.

James is joined by Patrick, an applied behavioural scientist who has run over 200 real-world experiments for businesses including Fortune 500 companies. \r\n\r\nWe joined forces through a shared frustration that no one really understands large scale human behaviours: traditional market research is not only slow and expensive, but fundamentally flawed - it misses how people influence each other.

Since releasing this publicly as \u201cWave\u201d, startup founders have run over 3000 simulations. \r\n\r\nWe have since released \"Reach\", where anyone can simulate their own LinkedIn audience and test how their posts will perform before posting for real.

We're solving the industry's biggest challenge: 50% annual member churn caused by poor post-enrollment engagement.\r\n\r\nOur multi-agent AI teams work together to handle the entire customer journey - from initial contact through enrollment and ongoing care. When a lead comes in after hours, one AI agent answers and schedules a callback, another calls at the perfect time, a third captures qualifying information, and a fourth handles the warm transfer to a licensed agent. This approach helped a leading FMO write over $2M in renewals during AEP 2024 while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale.\r\n\r\nWe've pioneered a purpose-built solution for Medicare's unique compliance requirements. Unlike generic AI platforms, our system features built-in HIPAA/CMS compliance, real-time data structuring, and seamless CRM integration. This enables agencies of all sizes to deliver enterprise-grade member care without massive infrastructure investments.\r\n\r\nEarly metrics show the power of our approach:\r\n\r\n- 5x increase in after-hours conversion rates\r\n- 37% improvement in 90-day retention\r\n- 3,000+ agent hours saved in a single AEP\r\n- $2M+ in additional renewals during AEP 2024\r\n\r\nThe Medicare Advantage market represents a massive opportunity, with over $360B in annual premiums and growing 10% year over year.

As the Chief of Staff, he witnessed first-hand the tedious process of finding great contract opportunities, the lengthy solicitation preparation process, and paper-based communication between departments.\r\n\r\nHe teamed up with Ben and Maciej, whom he met during Berkeley's M.E.T. admit day. Both of them had extensive experience in AI research and applications, which they applied to creating a powerful framework for humans and AI agents to collaborate during the lifecycle of a contract.\r\n\r\nWith SalesPatriot, your firm can run on autopilot - we find suitable contracts automatically, ingest RFQs from primes, streamline the communication between the departments, and provide analytics to improve your win rate.\r\n\r\nWether you are a manufacturer, reseller, or distributor, SalesPatriot can reduce your manual tasks, increase throughput, and boost your revenue.

We use cameras and AI to automatically fill federally-required paperwork, reducing the risk of companies being unable to sell their products and increasing factory throughput.\r\n\r\nUsers have told us the paperwork required for the F-35 fighter jet weighs more than the jet itself! The government requires a record for each of the 1.5 million parts in the jet, including what shop-floor workers do to each part and when they do it.\r\n\r\nAutomating paperwork by interpreting human actions with cameras is hard. Doing this at the edge and inside secure aerospace environments is harder. We fine-tune the latest vision language models to solve what was previously impossible.\r\n\r\nManufacturers lose millions when compliance paperwork has errors because it can freeze their ability to sell the product for months. Leaving this task to shop floor workers is both incredibly risky to the company and tedious for the employees. \r\n\r\nCompliance paperwork is just the beginning. We want to propel American manufacturing into the AI era. America is facing a serious problem: there\u2019s $400B being invested to onshore manufacturing, but there\u2019s simultaneously a projected 15% gap in workers needed due to an aging workforce.

Billing patients and collecting their payments is a complex process that requires specialized skills and a lot of effort. Traditionally, healthcare providers have done this manually, with limited automation around one-way reminders. This leads to limited engagement with payers and subpar collection results.\r\n\r\nArgovox changes this by making new levels of payer engagement possible at scale.

    "name": "Razorpay",
    "slug": "razorpay",
    "desc": "India's only full-stack financial solutions company for businesses. The journey of building Razorpay started in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder) witnessed the dismal state of the online payments industry in India then and understood that they have a larger and more important issue to solve. And That was democratizing online payments for Indian businesses, particularly the underserved market, Startups and SMEs. Over the last 9 years, Razorpay has evolved from a single-product company to a multi-product company, from an online payment gateway to India\u2019s only full-stack financial solutions company, offering payments and banking solutions to businesses.  Razorpay today is transforming age-old complexities and changing every known paradigm of money movement for disruptive businesses.\r\n\r\nOver the last couple of years, Razorpay\u2019s growth has evolved to be an index of India\u2019s digital economy. From a kirana shop in Kashmir collecting payments on our POS device to a textile exporter in Kanyakumari accepting dollars through our International Payments product, Razorpay has revolutionised how businesses have traditionally transacted and interacted with money. \r\n\r\nRazorpay became the first and only Indian fintech to build a full-stack international Payment Gateway \u2018Curlec by Razorpay\u2019 and evolved into a comprehensive provider of payment solutions, leveraging the synergy between cutting-edge technological capabilities and a profound understanding of the local payment ecosystem. The introduction of the new Curlec Payment Gateway aims to cater to a wide spectrum of businesses, expanding its reach to over 5,000 establishments. \r\n\r\nBe it for international expansion or solving for Indian businesses, for Razorpay, the customer has always been at the core of all disruption, from addressing evolving needs to delivering new solutions. This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay\u2019s several industry-first innovations into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first to launch a completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automate payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were introduced aling the way. Other firsts include: - First to launch India\u2019s Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ - Razorpay became India\u2019s first payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI - Razorpay also became India\u2019s largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is India\u2019s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the in-person offline payments experience.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Razorpay\u2019s valuation has jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion and has added a host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company to be a part of Silicon Valley\u2019s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company\u2019s valuation to $7.5 Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn. \r\n\r\nRazorpay has also made acquisitions with like-minded companies over the last 9 years. In total, till date, Razorpay has made eight acquisitions, Billme in 2023 - A Digital invoice and customer Engagement, Ezetap in 2022 - India\u2019s leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India\u2019s leading loyalty and reward management platform, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A recurring payments platform. TeraFin Labs in 2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions, Opfin (Now RazorpayX Payroll) in 2019 -  The payroll management solution and Thirdwatch in 2019, the first acquisition - The AI-powered fraud detection platform.\r\n\r\nAll these efforts are being done in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders so that India can build a better place for small and big businesses. Today, Razorpay powers online payments for 76 Of 100 startup unicorns and millions of businesses in India. The core premise of what Razorpay was founded in 2014 and what it is today hasn\u2019t changed. It is to make money movement simpler and easier, whether it is for businesses to receive money, send money, or manage money. \r\n\r\n",

With sequencing and synthesis being mainstream now [1], 20n provides the computational systems that predict DNA design for novel industrial biotech and health applications.\n\nAt 20n, we are taking a fresh look at turning biological data into information. We approach it as a big data learning problem, and bring to bear techniques from machine learning, distributed systems, AI planning, program synthesis, data mining, and natural language processing. With the support of DARPA [2], we are building a team of computer scientists, and bioengineers to look at biology in fundamentally new ways.\n\nOur current customers include industrial biotech firms that are leading the charge in transitioning us from traditional unsustainable means of manufacturing to sustainable biological processes leading to advanced fuels, materials, therapeutics, and flavors and fragrances. 20n\u2019s technology helps them enter markets previously thought inaccessible for biology.\n\n[1] Sequencing DNA costs $4k/genome (http://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts/) and is expected to go down to $1k/genome. Synthesizing DNA is at 20cents/bp, and is expected to go down to 0.1cents/bp.\n[2] DARPA in the past supported work that led to the internet, stealth planes, GPS, and even Douglas Engelbart\u2019s mother-of-all-demos.",

Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.\r\n\r\nThe Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO\u00ae, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.\r\n\r\nResearch from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nOsmind is a San Francisco\u2013based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator.",

Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. \r\n\r\nIn addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. \r\n\r\nWith this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. \r\n\r\nOur product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. \r\n\r\nThe company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others. We\u2019ve received a number of R&D grants from Innovate UK, Department for Transport and Horizons 2020. We\u2019re currently a team of 10 across Commercial, Product and Engineering (including 4. sub-teams cloud software, machine learning, automotive software and electronics).\r\n",

As opposed to a simulation, our neuromorphic hardware is a physical artificial neural network, composed of spiking neurons and physical synapses. We combine unique electroceramic materials, nanofabrication techniques, and biologically plausible models of learning to create the Memristive Nanowire Neural Network (MN3), a new type of AI chip.

This technology is not limited to gold and has been demonstrated to work on other metals, including base metals like copper.

Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets.

With over 16,000+ mutual funds and 5000+ stocks to choose from, they are far too complicated for beginners, who make up most of the market.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re building an AI - driven investment planning software that is designed for beginners. Users use our conversational AI to get diversified mutual fund portfolios tailored to their goals. We also offer users a credit card secured by their investments, so they can earn return without losing liquidity.\r\n\r\nIn terms of business model, we make commissions on the asset we manage, and interchange fees on the fund.

Our AI platform enables tremendous pace and capital efficiency as demonstrated by our progress in ~2 years with seed capital\u2014a stark contrast to the typical spend of $100M+ and 7+ years exhibited in the pharmaceuticals / biotech industry.\r\n \r\nWith ~90% of rare diseases having no therapeutic treatment at all, GEn1E is taking a giant swing that will hopefully bring life-saving therapies to the lives of patients in need.\r\n \r\nThe team at GEn1E has decades of experience in drug development and machine learning. We graduated from YCombinator and Stanford-StartX in late 2019. We are based in Palo Alto, CA.",

Partnering with Tahsin, a neighbour with a PhD in AI, and Mohammed, a seasoned engineering VP with experience in construction software, they turned the dream into reality.\r\n\r\nSince their launch in August, DraftAid has engaged customers through targeted outreach and word-of-mouth, securing paid pilots with subsequent contracts valued at $150,000.\r\n\r\nBe a part of ushering in the new era of CAD designs!",

Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce.\r\n\r\nWe integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n\r\nTop merchants using Yuma can automate up to 60% of their support tickets fully autonomously.\r\n\r\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\r\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\r\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\r\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\r\nYuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce.\r\n\r\nThese agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step.\r\n\r\nWe believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket.\r\n\r\nWe are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months.\r\n\r\n## Fun Fact\r\n\r\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again.",

This is the first step towards laying the foundations for Composable AI Systems; all AI systems need observability and introspection to be first class for them to be reliable.\r\n\r\nHow? We're standardizing how people write python to express data, ML, LLM, & agent workflows/pipelines/applications with lightweight frameworks. So that no matter the author, it'll be easy to collaborate, connect, and importantly in one line integrate observability and datastore needs. This speeds up time to production and reduces TCO because code remains easy to maintain and your data flywheel stays manageable. So you can increase the top line & bottom line of your business by delivering on AI that is reliable.\r\n\r\nWe've got two open source projects:\r\n- one focused on AI applications, called Burr (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).\r\n- one focused on AI pipelines/workflows, called Hamilton (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) see https://www.tryhamilton.dev\r\n\r\nBoth Hamilton & Burr come with self-hostable UIs (+ enterprise & SaaS offerings). With a one-line code change, you get versioning, lineage / tracing, cataloging, and observability out of the box with Hamilton. With Burr you get tracing, observability and persistence in a single line addition.\r\n",

We\u2019re on a mission to optimize the agricultural industry.\r\n\r\nWhen we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren\u2019t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.\r\n\r\nWe saw a problem we wanted to solve.\r\n\r\nToday, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we\u2019ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we\u2019re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",

Currently, we are focused on helping radiology AI teams prepare high-quality datasets to train their algorithms.\r\n\r\nRadiology data, such as CT and X-ray scans, is an incredibly important source of truth in healthcare delivery. In fact, over 90% of all healthcare data is medical imagery! However, the global radiology workforce is overburdened. In the UK, for example, only 2% of radiology departments are able to fulfill their reporting requirements, and this trend is reflected worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe acute state of radiology, coupled with the abundance of data, makes the use of AI in radiology a prime candidate. In 2022, $5.6 billion was invested in the development of AI in healthcare! However, a key hindrance to further adoption is the lack of sophisticated tools to build and deploy AI algorithms in clinical environments. This is the problem we\u2019re focused on at RedBrick AI\r\n\r\nWe're a team based out of Bangalore India, and USA.

We're commercializing 10+ years research done by our team at Harvard and MIT on this space. Our team wrote the very first papers on applying GenAI and optimization algorithms to compose robots from parts and applying computational design to fine tune machine designs. We're bringing in our deep knowledge of modifying equipment and integrating it into factories keenly understanding what makes hardware hard. \r\n\r\nWe take in parts under consideration, constraints and tasks at hand and our algorithm formulates and fine tunes from 100s of possible design options. All in a few clicks, so engineers can push hardware to market faster and companies can benefit from the inventions being done by their R&D teams.

Our team combines deep construction experience with technical expertise, Roya has a PhD in civil engineering, and Michael has worked at multiple construction tech startups.\r\n\r\nWhy hasn\u2019t this been done before? Construction is slow to adopt new tech, and reporting is messy, photos, voice notes, and field notes all live in silos. Turning that into a clear, structured report requires real insight into how inspectors work and what clients need. Only now, with advances in AI, can we process unstructured data adequately to generate high-quality reports in real time.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive.

You get the privacy of on-prem deployments, while running on the cloud.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don\u2019t have to tradeoff performance for privacy. \r\n\r\nUnder the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA\u2019s confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil\u2019s software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like \"trust us, we don\u2019t log your queries.\u201d Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user \u2014 not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it\u2019s processed on. \r\n\r\nThe founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.\r\n\r\nAs AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable.  By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.\r\n\r\nIf OpenAI is creating \u201cGod in a box\u201d, we are putting God in a blackbox, so Satan can\u2019t spy.",
