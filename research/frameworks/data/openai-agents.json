It focuses on a small set of core primitives: Agents (LLMs with instructions and tools), Handoffs (for agent delegation), and Guardrails (for input validation). The framework includes built-in tracing for debugging and monitoring, and is designed to be simple yet powerful, with Python-first orchestration that allows developers to leverage standard language features rather than learning new abstractions.",

It offers a straightforward, Python-first approach that allows developers to use familiar language features for orchestration rather than learning new concepts.

The automatic schema generation for function tools, built-in tracing, and compatibility with any model supporting the OpenAI Chat Completions API further enhance the developer experience.",

As a Python library, it can be deployed using standard Python deployment methods, but lacks dedicated deployment infrastructure compared to some other frameworks. The SDK's lightweight nature makes it relatively easy to integrate into existing systems, and its tracing capabilities support production monitoring. While there aren't explicit deployment guides or tools in the documentation, examples demonstrate integration with web services like Stripe API, suggesting adaptability to various deployment scenarios. The framework's focus is more on the agent functionality than deployment infrastructure.",
