  "framework_summary": "PydanticAI is a Python agent framework designed to make building production-grade applications with Generative AI less painful. Created by the team behind Pydantic, it brings the ergonomic design philosophy of FastAPI to GenAI app development. The framework is model-agnostic, supporting various LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and others. It emphasizes type safety, structured response validation, and dependency injection while allowing developers to leverage standard Python development practices for control flow and agent composition. PydanticAI focuses on delivering a developer-friendly experience that simplifies the development of reliable and maintainable AI applications.",
