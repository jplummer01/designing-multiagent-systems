  "framework_summary": "CrewAI is a lean, lightning-fast Python framework for building multi-agent AI applications, built entirely from scratch without dependencies on other agent frameworks like LangChain. It features two main components: 'Crews' that optimize for autonomous collaboration between AI agents with specific roles, and 'Flows' that enable granular, event-driven control for precise task orchestration. The framework emphasizes both high-level simplicity for beginners and low-level control for advanced customization, making it suitable for both simple tasks and complex enterprise-grade applications.",
