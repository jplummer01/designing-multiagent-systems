It allows developers to define agent behavior, orchestration, and tool use directly in code, focusing on tight integration with Google Cloud and Gemini models. ADK provides support for multi-agent systems through hierarchical composition, workflow agents (Sequential, Parallel, Loop), and LLM-driven delegation. The framework includes tools for local development through CLI and Web UI, evaluation of agent performance, and deployment options ranging from local environments to Vertex AI Agent Engine.",

Being relatively new, its community may not be as large as some more established frameworks, but it benefits from its integration with the broader Google Cloud and AI ecosystem. The framework supports interoperability with other agent frameworks through initiatives like the Agent2Agent protocol, and it can leverage tools from various sources including Model Context Protocol (MCP), LangChain, CrewAI, and any OpenAPI endpoints. The availability of sample agents in Agent Garden and documentation provide resources for developers to get started.",
