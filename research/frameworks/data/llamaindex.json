The framework supports both local deployment for development and distributed deployment for production, with each agent able to run as an independent microservice. The control plane architecture manages state, service registration, and task distribution, facilitating scalable and resilient systems. Additionally, LlamaCloud provides a managed service option for those seeking simplified deployment without infrastructure management.",
